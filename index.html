                        My name is Drew Reynolds. I am 24 years old. I was born in Houston, Texas but now live in Tomball, Texas. I enjoy watching and playing sports, hunting, excercising in my free time. I graduated Texas A&M University in 2018 where I studied Agricultural Economics. While at Texas A&M I began dating my now fiance, our wedding is scheduled for March 2020. We own two boxers that keep us very busy and entertained.

                            I work as a Business Analyst for start up software company, which has nothing to do with the degree that earned but I enjoy working for a start up company as it has exposed me to many things I do not believe I would've had the opportunity to experience at a bigger corporation. Working at my company also introduced me to software development, which then sparked my interest in learning this technical skill. I plan to use the skills I learn from coding bootcamp to become a full stack developer at my current job to help with the development with current and new software applications.
